## Seat Organiser
Programme to take the seats in the Poolesville High School Auditorium and automatically create a seating chart by class based on a number of factors

Noisy classes will be placed in the back, away from the stage. Classrooms will be used in the event of an overflow. Any classes from rooms 100+ will be placed together, so they can get there earlier. There will be 3 columns, which will be converted to three jagged arrays. To use, the user will upload an excel file, and any classes by last name that they wish to sit in the back. The programme will do the rest for them, and will output an image and word document in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0kBiRQ_pexzbW1MQ1JNTW5DYXc/view?usp=sharing) format for the user to see, saving immense amounts of time.

Although not in the repository, this requires an excel document of class name, grade, room number, period, and teacher and bundles the apache POI and Apache Commons IO.
